        Before I die I\'m tryna **** you, baby \n </br> <br>
Hopefully we don\'t have no babies \n </br> <br>
I don\'t even wanna go back home \n </br> <br>
Hopefully, I don\'t leave you on your own \n </br> <br>
Ayy \n </br> <br>
Trips that you plan for the next whole week \n </br> <br>
Bands too long for a brother so cheap \n </br> <br>
And your flex OD, and your *** OD \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it (ayy) \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got (yeah) \n </br> <br>
Pretty lil\' thing, you got a bag and now you wildin\' \n </br> <br>
You just took it off the lot, no mileage \n </br> <br>
Way they hittin\' you, the DM lookin\' v****** \n </br> <br>
Talkin\' wild, you come around and now they silent \n </br> <br>
Flew the c**p at 17, no guidance \n </br> <br>
You be stayin\' low but you know what the vibes is \n </br> <br>
Ain\'t never got you nowhere bein\' modest \n </br> <br>
Poppin\' **** but only \'cause you know you\'re poppin\', yeah \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it (ayy) \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it \n </br> <br>
Lil\' baby in her bag, in her ****** \n </br> <br>
No nine to five, put the work in \n </br> <br>
Flaws and all, I love \'em all, to me, you\'re perfect \n </br> <br>
Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (oh-oh) \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it, girl (ooh) \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna play no games, play no games \n </br> <br>
**** around, give you my last name (oh) \n </br> <br>
Know you tired of the same damn thing \n </br> <br>
That\'s okay \'cause, baby, you \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it (ayy) \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it \n </br> <br>
You the only one I\'m tryna make love to, pickin\' and choosin\' \n </br> <br>
They ain\'t really love you, runnin\' games, usin\' \n </br> <br>
All your stupid exes, they gon\' call again \n </br> <br>
Tell \'em that a real brother steppin\' in \n </br> <br>
Don\'t let them brothers try you, test your patience \n </br> <br>
Tell \'em that it\'s over, ain\'t no debatin\' (uh) \n </br> <br>
All you need is me playin\' on your playlist \n </br> <br>
You ain\'t gotta be frustrated \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna play no games, play no games (oh) \n </br> <br>
**** around, give you my last name (my last name) \n </br> <br>
Know you tired of the same damn thing (same damn thing) \n </br> <br>
That\'s okay \'cause, baby, you \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it (oh, ooh, ayy) \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it (got it) \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna \n </br> <br>
Before I d*e, I\'m tryna **** you, baby (yeah) \n </br> <br>
Hopefully, we don\'t have no babies (ooh) \n </br> <br>
I don\'t even wanna go back home \n </br> <br>
Hopefully, I don\'t leave you on your own \n </br> <br>
You got it, girl, you got it, oh \n </br> <br>
Play no games (no) \n </br> <br>
Freaky (freaky) \n </br> <br>
I can learn a lot from you, gotta come teach me (woo, woo) \n </br> <br>
You a lil\' hot girl, you a lil\' sweetie (no, sweet) \n </br> <br>
Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (like that) \n </br> <br>
I can tell you crazy, but **** kind of intrigue me (no, yeah, I like that) \n </br> <br>
(I don\'t wanna, I don\'t wanna) \n </br> <br>
Seen it on the \'Gram, I\'m tryna see that **** in 3D, mami \n </br> <br>
I know I get around \'cause I like to move freely \n </br> <br>
(I don\'t, I don\'t) \n </br> <br>
But you could lock it down, I could tell by how you treat me \n </br> <br>
(I don\'t, I don\'t) \n </br> <br>
I seen how you did homeboy, so please take it easy (no, yeah) \n </br> <br>
Good to have me on your side, I ain\'t sayin\' that you need me (yeah, yeah) \n </br> <br>
Six God talk but I ain\'t tryna get preachy (no, no, no) \n </br> <br>
I seen how you did homeboy, please take it easier on me \n </br> <br>
\'Cause I don\'t wanna (no) play no games, play no games \n </br> <br>
(I don\'t wanna, I don\'t wanna) \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna play no games, play no games \n </br> <br>
(I don\'t, I don\'t) \n </br> <br>
I don\'t, I don\'t \n </br> <br>
No \n </br>
